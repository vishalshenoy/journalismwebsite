  Medical Perspective</b>
</center>
    <br>
    <p>A person walks into an alley and spots a group of people smoking cannabis. What are their instinctive thoughts? Most people would hold their breaths and walk past them, simply labeling them as irresponsible &ldquo;potheads.&rdquo; But is it an accurate assumption?</p>
<p>Ever since California legalized the recreational use of cannabis in 2016, medical weed users, generally overlooked, are often categorized into reckless, recreational individuals. Specifically, teenagers with a prescribed medical marijuana card are typically classified as &ldquo;impulsive&rdquo; who use drugs carelessly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such stereotyping behaviors, however, are far from the truth, as a variety of people with mental health issues or other disorders are using marijuana for medicinal purposes. According to Journal Military, Veteran and Family Health (JMVFH), nearly &ldquo;52% of Canadian veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder use cannabis&rdquo; as a form of escape, relaxation, and pain management. In fact, minors diagnosed with a certain medical condition qualifies them into receiving a legal medical marijuana card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changing lenses, students &mdash; age of 18 or under &mdash; are also applicable for acquiring the &ldquo;plants&rdquo; from weed dispensaries. They undergo a series of steps: filling out an online application, connecting with a medical doctor, and receiving a recommended amount of cannabis. Under the name of the parent or the minor&rsquo;s guardian, students can visit any dispensaries within their respective state and receive the prescribed amount &mdash; not to mention that students can also grow cannabis plants at home.</p>
<p>In particular, a Cupertino alumnus shared how weed played an essential role when coping with their medical condition: dissociative identity disorder (DID). Experiencing constant moments of detachment from identity and surroundings, they struggled to continue the healthy, productive lifestyle. Shared the alumnus, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried almost a whole spectrum of medications, but nothing was working, and I felt that hospitals were simply throwing prescriptions at me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accepting the fact that they were diagnosed with DID was difficult to process, as they mentioned how &ldquo;the side effects were kicking in [left and right] and life was an absolute chaos.&rdquo; &mdash; and that was when weed offered a solution to their troubled life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only reason why I ever made it to this point in life was because of weed,&rdquo; said the alumnus. &ldquo;Floating a thick cloud while playing music in the car helped me escape from this world momentarily, and I loved that feeling.&rdquo; People have various ways of coping with their stress brewed from academics, friends, or personal reasons; for the alumnus, their main source for &ldquo;de-stressing&rdquo; was weed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But indeed, dealing with the numerous stigmas revolving around weed was simply inevitable. The alumnus recalls back on an instance when &ldquo;people in [my] classroom would start laughing or giggle whenever someone mentioned the terms &lsquo;weed&rsquo; or &lsquo;marijuana.&rsquo;&rdquo; Shared the alumnus, &ldquo;people are simply portrayed as &lsquo;stoners&rsquo; because they use weed, but some people actually rely on it to live to see tomorrow.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amidst the general community of smokers, particular individuals&mdash;like the alumnus&mdash;consider weed as a source that keeps them conscious of their life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weed is like my lifeline,&rdquo; concluded the alumnus.&nbsp;</p>
