  Recreational Perspective</b>
</center>
    <br>
    <p>Marijuana. Pot. Dope. Reefer. Mary Jane. No matter what you call it, weed has certainly earned a variety of opposing stigmas and praises for its recreational purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The development of increasingly casual attitudes and relaxation of legal restrictions around weed have contributed to a rise in its recreational usage over the past few decades. Recent studies conducted by the Washington Post show that over 60% of high school seniors think marijuana is &ldquo;safe&rdquo; to use. Additionally, U.S. federal health data indicates that 6.3% of high school students use weed at least once a month.</p>
<p>Weed has been continuously glamorized by the media &mdash; advertisements creating a connotation of pleasure and celebrities ostentatiously smoking on social media flaunt the liberating benefits of weed. For example, influential rappers such as Lil Uzi Vert and Kid Cudi portray their recreational lifestyle, which includes smoking weed, to impressionable high school students through social media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These influences have directly impacted students at CHS. An anonymous CHS student shares, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t smoke, but I feel like weed is the best because it helps many people with anxiety; it&rsquo;s better than smoking [a cigarette] or vaping.&rdquo; Indeed, weed still has many negative side effects which include breathing problems and increased heart rate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adonis, whose name has been changed to maintain anonymity, is another CHS student who regularly smokes weed. As for the factors which influenced them to smoke, Adonis mentioned, &ldquo;What got me into smoking weed was definitely the influence of other friends that had been doing it for a longer time, because hanging around with them constantly, obviously you start thinking [...] Why are they doing that? What's so good about it? You know, you just get curious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These social influences among weed users result in a close-knit community. Adonis added, &ldquo;I feel like people who smoke weed, who are also called stoners, are very kind to one another [...] There is a community or [...] a family type of thing. I just see it a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In California, the minimum age requirement to purchase weed is 21 years old and medical marijuana cards require recipients to be at least 18 years old. Even then, most students do not have a medical marijuana card; they often rely on older friends or siblings to attain the &ldquo;devil&rsquo;s lettuce&rdquo;. The complexities of this system create a nuanced community in which weed users can easily empathize with each other&rsquo;s struggles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many reasons for why an individual would choose to smoke weed. Some recreational weed users may desire the psychedelic adventure of being high. For Adonis and many other students, weed is a forum of managing stress in overwhelming situations. Adonis added, &ldquo;If you ever have [...] something to think about when you're high, you can think about it in a different way, in a deeper level of meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simultaneously, weed can complicate these negative feelings if used at inappropriate times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, it gets pretty overwhelming if you're having bad thoughts [while smoking weed] because they just multiply,&rdquo; Adonis said, adding, &ldquo;I only smoke weed at night... to help me relax, just meditate at the end of the day [...] and that will be it. Or sometimes, I&rsquo;ll get high and watch a movie [...] to enjoy it and be happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The positive experiences and a strong social culture surrounding weed contribute to its existence as a highly addictive stimulant among high school students. Concerning weed habits among the youth, Adonis believes, &ldquo;It's not even a bad thing to continue because you choose to not stop [...] It's like a little bit of goodness in your life.&rdquo;</p>
